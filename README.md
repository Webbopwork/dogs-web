# dogs-web
A internet browser with UI using the DOGS networking protocol. Made with GTK4 in Rust.

![A image that the client has recieved from a server of a orange kitten looking at the camera while sitting on a red blanket. The kitten is named cheddar, the "Path" field in the client says "cheddar"](cheddar_as_image_example.png)

![A fluffy character smoking a blunt sent through this project's browser in text-art form](blunt_sent_through_dogs.png)

## Note:
In order to compile this you might need certain dependencies.
That problem can be solved with this command on Fedora Linux 42:
```sh
sudo dnf install gtk4-devel
```
